<p>~Changed the base walking speed to be 6.
This syncs up with the walking animation and makes more sense; you&rsquo;re walking. You should be at a walking speed.</p>

            <description>Gonna pick up this project again. I have an idea on making a &amp;ldquo;Brain&amp;rdquo; system I can just drag and drop into NPCs. Here&amp;rsquo;s the Eye/tracking system
+Added NPC sight system
Different Eyes! Example 1 Your browser does not support the video tag.Planning for other NPC brain power. Sight is ooonly the beginning! I have an idea to add Hearing, and Memory. Memory will be really useful for when the NPC can walk.</description>

<p>Planning for other NPC brain power.
Sight is ooonly the beginning! I have an idea to add Hearing, and Memory. Memory will be really useful for when the NPC can walk. For example, enemy NPCs will remember common paths a player takes and could possibly ambush them.</p>

            <description>Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Hex n I&amp;rsquo;m from the US! I also go by Hexa if there&amp;rsquo;s another &amp;ldquo;Hex&amp;rdquo; present. I am a &amp;ldquo;jack-of-all-trades&amp;rdquo; meaning i specialize in many different skills, such as digital and traditional art, 3d modeling, coding, story telling, and game making.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have much going on in my life, but at the moment I&amp;rsquo;m majoring in bio-chemistry so I can eventually be an anesthesiologist.
Thanks for checking out my blog </description>

            <description>Content Warning? Blood | I tripped my foot on a hurt part on accident lol
Added a debug to change the lighting
Your browser does not support the video tag.Also added a display for skintones. My vision is that these will be the only skintones in the game but you can use a slider to change the brightness and saturation to your liking

            <description>Content Warning? Blood
Made it so the player&amp;rsquo;s health affects the players normal speed/sprinting speed. I remember this taking a long time and just being generally annoying to make.
